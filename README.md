## Steps in the script

1. Load Dataset
Reads the raw CSV from the Data/Raw/ folder.

2. Remove Duplicates

- Discount Applied is filled with False and converted to boolean.

4. Convert Column Types
Converts Transaction Date to datetime for proper date handling.

5. Recalculate Total Spent
Corrects any inconsistencies: Total Spent = Price Per Unit Ã— Quantity (rounded to 1 decimal).

6. Save Cleaned Dataset
Saves the cleaned CSV to the Data/Clean/ folder.

7. Preview Cleaned Data
